It features a large analogue style, one control per function processing block, TouchScreen, name and colour virtual "write-on" strip, banks of motorised faders with independent layers, SoftKeys, built-in headphones, local monitor and talkback. The modular iLive-80 allows a variety of audio I/O modules, network formats and redundant power supply options, and can be shipped in a touring flight case.',

AES Digital Output Option available, offering 2 AES3 digital stereo outputs in place of 4 analogue line outputs. iDR-64 can be ordered with a single AES Digital Output Option pre-fitted.

            posting: 'The Xone:2D is a combination of an 18-channel USB 2.0 soundcard and MIDI controller, which DJâ€™s can combine with their existing analogue mixer to create a complete digital DJ mixing system, perfect for integration with DJ software such as Ableton Live and Traktor. The 96kHz 24-bit USB 2.0 soundcard is provided with a large array of connections for easy interfacing into any DJ setup, while MIDI clocks are generated using the tap tempo button or by analysing the BPM of incoming audio, available from all input channels. One of the input channels can be switched between mic and line, while the other two are phono/line, and the unit is completed by a comprehensive onboard monitoring system.',
